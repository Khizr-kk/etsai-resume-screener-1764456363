Hi [Fresher's Name],

I know the struggle. Applying for software jobs as a fresher in India is a tough grind. High competition, countless applications, and the constant question: "Why am I not getting interviews?"

Most rejections happen because resumes don't clearly match the job description. You're likely missing specific keywords or skills that recruiters are looking for. And without clear feedback, it's a frustrating guessing game.

That's why we built JobFit AI.

Our platform uses AI to analyze your resume against any software engineering job description. We give you clear, actionable feedback:
*   Exactly how well your resume matches.
*   Specific skills or keywords you might be missing.
*   Recommendations to improve your fit.

Stop wasting time on applications that don't hit the mark. Start tailoring your resume with precision and confidence.

Ready to transform your job search? Give JobFit AI a try today.
